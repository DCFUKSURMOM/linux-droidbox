In order to avoid having to maintain 2 Xbox kernels, I have moved all development to here. My orignal fork has been archived
This kernel works just fine as a "normal" kernel so there is no reason to have a completely separate one.

This is an experimental Android x86 Linux kernel for the orignal Xbox

The kernel version is 5.13.19

Linux 5.13.19 was the last kernel version with the legacy ide drivers available, since I don't know if the modern drivers work on actual hardware I have decided to keep a branch available that still has them in place.
I do still have the modern drivers set as the default, but you have to option to switch back with this version.
Newer kernels that do not have the legacy drivers at all will be in their own branches if I get them booting. This kernel does seem to work but I am only able to test in XEMU (Xbox emulator) at the moment so your mileage may vary. If someone can test this on hardware for me it would be appreciated.

This kernel was originally a hybrid of these 2 kernels:

https://github.com/XboxDev/xbox-linux (Linux 5.8.1)

https://github.com/maurossi/linux/tree/kernel-5.8_si_next (Linux 5.8)

But it has since been updated.

For a "normal" xbox kernel config without any Android stuff, use xbox_defconfig

For a xbox kernel config with Android settings enabled, use droidbox_defconfig, its based on the xbox_defconfig and just has the extra settings enabled, it also enables the droidbox logo at boot

The normal androidx86 defconfigs are also available but these are standard pc configs and will not work on the Xbox.

There is nothing stopping you from building this kernel for any hardware supported by stock Linux 5.13.19 (that I'm aware of at least)

The current droidbox logo is just a placeholder, something I quickly made in GIMP to add a personal touch, it may be replaced in the future.

You will need the Cromwell bios or some other linux loader installed on your Xbox to use this kernel
