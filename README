This is an experimental mainline Linux kernel for the orignal Xbox

It boots in XEMU but does not have a working framebuffer, it is untested on hardware

To get a serial console and interact with the running system, run xemu in a terminal and add "-device lpc47m157 -serial mon:stdio" to its command line options, the required kernel drivers for serial have already been enabled in the defconfigs

The kernel version is 6.15.0-rc6

For a "normal" xbox kernel config without any Android stuff, use xbox_defconfig

For a xbox kernel config with Android settings enabled, use droidbox_defconfig, its based on the xbox_defconfig and just has the extra settings enabled, it also enables the droidbox logo at boot

There is nothing stopping you from building this kernel for any hardware supported by stock Linux (that I'm aware of at least)

You will need the Cromwell bios or some other linux loader installed on your Xbox (or XEMU) to use this kernel
