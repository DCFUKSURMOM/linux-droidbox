In order to avoid having to maintain 2 Xbox kernels, I have moved all development to here. My orignal fork has been archived
This kernel works just fine as a "normal" kernel so there is no reason to have a completely separate one.

This is an experimental Android x86 Linux kernel for the orignal Xbox

The kernel version is 5.9 and is based on https://github.com/maurossi/linux/tree/kernel-5.9_si_next with the xbox patches from xbox linux

It was originally a hybrid of these 2 kernels:

https://github.com/XboxDev/xbox-linux (Linux 5.8.1)

https://github.com/maurossi/linux/tree/kernel-5.8_si_next (Linux 5.8)

But it has since been updated. (I'm pretty much just applying the xbox patches to existing android x86 kernels)

For a "normal" xbox kernel config without any Android stuff, use xbox_defconfig

For a xbox kernel config with Android settings enabled, use droidbox_defconfig, its based on the xbox_defconfig and just has the extra settings enabled, it also enables the droidbox logo at boot

The normal androidx86 defconfigs are also available but these are standard pc configs and will not work on the Xbox.

There is nothing stopping you from building this kernel for any hardware supported by stock Linux 5.8 (that I'm aware of at least)

The current droidbox logo is just a placeholder, something I quickly made in GIMP to add a personal touch, it may be replaced in the future.
