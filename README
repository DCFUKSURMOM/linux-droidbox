This is an experimental Android x86 Linux kernel for the orignal Xbox

The kernel version is 5.8

It is a hybrid of these 2 kernels:

https://github.com/XboxDev/xbox-linux (Linux 5.8.1)

https://github.com/maurossi/linux/tree/kernel-5.8_si_next (Linux 5.8)

For a normal xbox kernel config without any Android settings use xbox_defconfig

For a kernel config with Android settings enabled, use droidbox_defconfig, its based on the xbox_defconfig and just has the extra settings enabled, it also enables the (custom) logo at boot

The stock normal androidx86 defconfigs are also available but these are standard pc configs and will not work on the Xbox.

There is nothing stopping you from building this kernel for any hardware supported by stock Linux 5.8 (that I'm aware of at least)

The current logo is just a placeholder, something I quickly made in GIMP to add a personal touch, it may be replaced in the future.
